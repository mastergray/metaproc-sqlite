### Acknowledgements
I did not create the sample database I've been using for testing - this was downloaded from [sqlitetutorial.net](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/). I could not find any licensing anywhere specifying terms of use, so if I need to I will be more than happy to remove. But I've decided to include it here because I've found it to very useful for testing - not to mention if I were to create a bogus database I would have probably of used music too.

The schema can be downloaded from [here](https://cdn.sqlitetutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sqlite-sample-database-diagram-color.pdf) if need be.
